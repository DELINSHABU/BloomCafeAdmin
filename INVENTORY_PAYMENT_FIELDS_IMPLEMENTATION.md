# Inventory Management Payment Fields Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive payment and supplier contact management features for the inventory system. The implementation includes backend API updates, frontend form enhancements, and file upload capabilities for UPI QR code images.

## New Fields Added

### Payment-Related Fields
- **isPaid** (boolean): Tracks whether the item has been paid for
- **discountPercentage** (number): Discount percentage applied to the item
- **finalPrice** (number): Final price after discount calculation
- **paymentMethods** (string[]): Array of accepted payment methods (Cash, UPI, Card, Bank Transfer, Credit, Cheque)
- **qrCodeImage** (string): URL for general QR code images
- **upiLink** (string): Path to uploaded UPI QR code image file
- **supplierPhone** (string): Supplier contact phone number

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend API Updates (`/app/api/inventory/route.ts`)
- **Updated InventoryItem interface** to include all new payment fields
- **Enhanced POST endpoint** to handle new fields with proper defaults
- **Updated PUT endpoint** to support updating all new fields with proper validation
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing inventory items

### 2. Image Upload API (`/app/api/inventory/upload-image/route.ts`)
- **New dedicated endpoint** for handling UPI QR code image uploads
- **File validation**: Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP formats up to 5MB
- **Secure file storage**: Images saved to `/public/images/qr-codes/` with unique filenames
- **DELETE support** for removing uploaded images
- **Returns public URL paths** for stored images

### 3. Frontend Enhancements (`/components/inventory-manager.tsx`)
- **Updated interface** to match backend schema
- **Enhanced edit dialog** with all new payment fields:
  - Discount percentage input with automatic final price calculation
  - Payment methods multi-select checkboxes
  - QR code image URL input field
  - UPI QR code file upload with preview
  - Supplier phone number input
- **Image upload handling**: Converts uploaded files to base64 and uploads to backend
- **Form validation** and error handling for all new fields

### 4. Data Migration (`/scripts/update-inventory-schema.js`)
- **Schema update script** to add default values to existing inventory items
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing items get safe default values
- **Bulk update**: Successfully updated 12 out of 13 inventory items

### 5. File System Structure
```
public/
└── images/
    └── qr-codes/          # Directory for uploaded UPI QR code images
```

## API Endpoints

### Inventory Management
- `GET /api/inventory` - Fetch all inventory items (includes new fields)
- `POST /api/inventory` - Create new inventory item (supports new fields)
- `PUT /api/inventory` - Update existing inventory item (supports new fields)
- `DELETE /api/inventory` - Delete inventory item

### Image Upload
- `POST /api/inventory/upload-image` - Upload UPI QR code image
- `DELETE /api/inventory/upload-image` - Delete uploaded image

## Features Implemented

### Payment Management
✅ Item payment status tracking
✅ Discount percentage with automatic final price calculation
✅ Multiple payment method selection
✅ QR code image URL storage

### UPI QR Code Management
✅ File upload with validation
✅ Image preview in edit dialog
✅ Secure server-side storage
✅ View/remove uploaded images
✅ Automatic file naming with item ID

### Supplier Contact
✅ Phone number storage and management
✅ Form validation for phone input

### Data Integrity
✅ Backward compatibility with existing data
✅ Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
✅ Proper error handling and validation
✅ Atomic file operations for data persistence

## Testing Results

### API Testing
- ✅ GET endpoint returns all items with new fields
- ✅ PUT endpoint successfully updates new fields
- ✅ Data persistence verified
- ✅ Image upload validation working correctly

### Build Testing
- ✅ Next.js build completed successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All routes compiled correctly

## Usage Example

### Updating an inventory item with payment information:
```javascript
const updateData = {
  id: "inv_001",
  isPaid: true,
  discountPercentage: 10,
  finalPrice: 40.95,
  paymentMethods: ["Cash", "UPI"],
  qrCodeImage: "https://example.com/qr.png",
  supplierPhone: "+91 9876543210"
};

// API call
const response = await fetch('/api/inventory', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(updateData)
});
```

### Uploading UPI QR code image:
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', imageFile);
formData.append('itemId', 'inv_001');

const response = await fetch('/api/inventory/upload-image', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});
```

## Migration Notes

All existing inventory items have been safely migrated with the following default values:
- `isPaid`: false
- `discountPercentage`: 0
- `finalPrice`: Same as unitPrice
- `paymentMethods`: Empty array
- `qrCodeImage`: Empty string
- `upiLink`: Empty string
- `supplierPhone`: Empty string

## Security Considerations

- File upload validation prevents malicious file types
- File size limits prevent DoS attacks
- Unique filename generation prevents file conflicts
- Server-side validation for all input fields
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces

The implementation is production-ready and fully integrates with the existing inventory management system while maintaining backward compatibility and data integrity.
