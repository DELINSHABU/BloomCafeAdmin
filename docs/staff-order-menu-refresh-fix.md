# Staff Assisted Order - Menu Refresh Fix

## Issue Description
When users changed the staff member in the Staff Assisted Order page after entering a password, the menu items would not refresh and would show "Menu Items 0 Available". This happened because the menu data was only loaded once when the component mounted and was not refreshed when the staff member changed.

## Root Cause
The `getMenuDataWithAvailability()` function was only called once in the `useEffect` hook during component initialization. When the staff member changed (after successful password verification), the menu availability data was not reloaded, causing the menu to show outdated or empty data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extracted `loadMenuData` Function
- Moved the menu data loading logic from `useEffect` into a separate async function `loadMenuData`
- This function handles both menu data and combos loading with proper error handling

### 2. Added Menu Refresh After Staff Change  
- Modified the password submit handler to call `loadMenuData()` after successful staff verification
- This ensures the menu data is refreshed with the latest availability information

### 3. Added Loading State Management
- Added `isLoadingMenu` state to track when menu data is being refreshed
- Added loading overlay to provide visual feedback during menu refresh
- The overlay shows a spinner and "Refreshing menu data..." message

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Loading state prevents user interaction during refresh
- Visual feedback lets users know the system is updating
- Seamless transition after successful password verification

## Code Changes

### Key modifications in `components/staff-order-page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Added loading state
const [isLoadingMenu, setIsLoadingMenu] = useState(false);

// Extracted loadMenuData function
const loadMenuData = async () => {
  try {
    const [menuData, combosData] = await Promise.all([
      getMenuDataWithAvailability(),
      getActiveCombos(),
    ]);
    setMenuData(menuData);
    setCombos(combosData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error loading menu data:", error);
    // Fallback to sync version
    const fallbackData = getMenuDataWithAvailabilitySync();
    setMenuData(fallbackData);
    setCombos([]);
  }
};

// Modified password handler to reload menu data
onPasswordSubmit={async (password) => {
  const user = staffCredentials.users.find((u) => u.name === pendingStaffSelection);
  if (user && password === user.password) {
    setSelectedStaff(pendingStaffSelection);
    setShowPasswordDrawer(false);
    setPendingStaffSelection("");
    setPasswordError("");
    
    // Show loading and reload menu data after successful staff change
    setIsLoadingMenu(true);
    await loadMenuData();
    setIsLoadingMenu(false);
  } else {
    setPasswordError('Incorrect password! Please try again.');
  }
}}
```

### Added Loading Overlay:
```tsx
{/* Loading Overlay during menu refresh */}
{isLoadingMenu && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center z-50">
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
      <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-8 w-8 border-b-2 border-emerald-600"></div>
      <p className="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 font-medium">Refreshing menu data...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

## Benefits

1. **Fixed Core Issue**: Menu items now properly refresh when staff member changes
2. **Better UX**: Loading feedback during refresh process
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensures latest menu availability is always shown
4. **Error Handling**: Proper fallback mechanisms in case of API failures
5. **Visual Polish**: Professional loading overlay with clear messaging

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Build compiles successfully without errors
- ✅ Menu data refreshes after successful password verification
- ✅ Loading state provides appropriate user feedback
- ✅ Error handling maintains functionality even if API fails
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Impact

This fix resolves the menu availability display issue and ensures that staff members always see the current, accurate menu data when placing orders for customers. The enhanced user experience with loading states makes the application feel more responsive and professional.
