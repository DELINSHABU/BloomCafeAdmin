# Waiter Dashboard - Task Management Feature

## Overview
The Task Management feature has been added to the Waiter Dashboard, allowing waiters to view and manage tasks assigned to them by the Super Admin.

## Features Added

### 1. WaiterTaskManagement Component (`components/waiter-task-management.tsx`)
A dedicated component that provides:
- **Task Display**: Shows all tasks assigned to the current waiter
- **Task Status Management**: Allows waiters to update task status (Pending → In Progress → Completed)
- **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by status and priority
- **Task Details**: View task descriptions, due dates, assigned by, and categories
- **Overdue Detection**: Highlights overdue tasks with red borders and badges
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh functionality to sync with the latest task data

### 2. Updated Waiter Dashboard (`components/waiter-dashboard.tsx`)
Enhanced with:
- **New Tab Structure**: Added main tabs for "Order Management" and "Task Management"
- **Integrated Task Component**: Task Management tab contains the WaiterTaskManagement component
- **Preserved Existing Functionality**: All existing order management features remain unchanged

## Task Management Interface

### Task Summary Cards
- **Pending Tasks**: Shows count of tasks waiting to be started
- **In Progress Tasks**: Shows count of tasks currently being worked on
- **Completed Tasks**: Shows count of finished tasks
- **Overdue Tasks**: Shows count of tasks past their due date

### Task Filtering
- **Status Filter**: Filter by Pending, In Progress, Completed, or Overdue
- **Priority Filter**: Filter by Low, Medium, or High priority
- **Clear Filters**: Reset all filters to show all tasks

### Task Cards
Each task displays:
- **Task Title and Description**
- **Status and Priority Badges**
- **Category Icon** (Service, Cleaning, Inventory, Training, etc.)
- **Assignment Details**: Who assigned the task and when
- **Due Date**: When the task needs to be completed
- **Overdue Warning**: Red border and badge for overdue tasks
- **Status Update Dropdown**: Change task status (if not completed)

### Task Status Flow
1. **Pending** → **In Progress** → **Completed**
2. **Overdue**: Automatically flagged when due date passes and task isn't completed

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/tasks`: Fetches all tasks, filtered to show only those assigned to current waiter
- `POST /api/tasks`: Updates task status when waiter changes it

### Data Flow
1. Component loads tasks on mount and filters by current user's name
2. Waiter can update task status through dropdown
3. Status changes are sent to API and local state is updated
4. Refresh button allows manual sync with server

## User Experience

### Navigation
- Waiters can switch between "Order Management" and "Task Management" tabs
- Order Management retains all existing functionality with sub-tabs
- Task Management provides a clean, focused view of assigned tasks

### Visual Feedback
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while loading tasks
- **Empty States**: Informative messages when no tasks are found
- **Status Colors**: Color-coded badges for different statuses and priorities
- **Overdue Alerts**: Visual warnings for tasks past due date

### Real-time Features
- Refresh button with loading animation
- Status updates reflect immediately in the interface
- Task counts update dynamically as statuses change

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- **WaiterTaskManagement**: Main task management component
- **Modified WaiterDashboard**: Enhanced with tab structure
- **Existing Task API**: Reuses the existing `/api/tasks` endpoint

### Data Management
- Tasks filtered by `assignedTo` matching current user's name
- Local state management with React hooks
- API integration for persistent updates
- Error handling for network issues

### Styling
- Consistent with existing dashboard design
- Responsive layout works on mobile and desktop
- Uses existing UI components and color scheme

## Usage
1. **Login as a Waiter**: Use waiter credentials to access dashboard
2. **Navigate to Tasks**: Click on "Task Management" tab
3. **View Tasks**: See all assigned tasks with their current status
4. **Update Status**: Use dropdown to mark tasks as in progress or completed
5. **Filter Tasks**: Use filters to find specific tasks
6. **Refresh**: Use refresh button to sync with latest data

This feature enhances the waiter workflow by providing clear visibility into assigned tasks while maintaining the existing order management functionality.
